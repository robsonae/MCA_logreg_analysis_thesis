# MCA_logreg_analysis_thesis
The code used in the exploratory and confirmatory statistical analyses of the data from my BA thesis.

### Thesis title: <b> A corpus-based analysis of the metaphorical representation of FATE in English and Polish </b>

The following code uses R packages FactoMineR as well as explor to create MCA plots of the data and to perform logistic regression analyses.
The code is relatively unstructured (sorry for that)
